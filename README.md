# Elastomer_Phase_Transitions

This repository contains all the electronic material (code, data, etc) needed to replicate the findings of the manuscript titled "Chiral phase-coexistence in compressed double-twist elastomers" by Matthew P Leighton, Laurent Kreplak, and Andrew D Rutenberg. In particular, the contents include:

## Arxiv Submission
The latex code, figures, and .bib file that comprise the version of the manuscript submitted to the arxiv.

## Figures
This folder contains pdf and copies of the four figures that are included in the manuscript.

## Figure_Code
This folder contains python scripts used to produce each of the figures in the manuscript. Scripts are straightforward, and primarily just plot equations derived in the text of the manuscript. The only non-trivial code is a set of functions that calculate the coexistence points of a common tangent construction for a non-convex free energy functionc (for figures 2,3, and 4). Note that the script 'Fig2.py' must be run in a specific data subfolder, which is indicated by comments in the script.
